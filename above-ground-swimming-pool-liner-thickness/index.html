<p>Vinyl liners are measured in units called mils Be sure that the liner you choose is resistant to cracking tearing and puncturing. Thicker liners do have other advantages though in providing protection from the sun and keeping your pool looking brighter with less chance of discoloration. Nobody sells more swimming pool liners in the UK than PoolStore so our prices are as you would expect well below our competitors. Depending on whether a vinyl liner is going into an above-ground or an in-ground swimming pool its thickness will run from 15 gauge up to 30 gauge. I would request from your local dealer the thickest liner they have available for that style of pool.</p>
