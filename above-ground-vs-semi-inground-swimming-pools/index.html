<p>There are pros and cons of above ground pool but above ground pool advantages weigh more. They are aesthetically more pleasing than above ground pools as you can add features such as decking or pavers to create the appearance of an inground. In addition above-ground pools are far easier to winterize as it is mainly a matter of shocking the pool with the proper chemicals draining enough water to allow room for the giant pillow that keeps the cover afloat and then. Inground pools simply look better than above-ground pools. Pin By Jeana Wallin Nunley On Incredible Pools Swimming Pools Inground Backyard Pool Landscaping Radiant Pools.</p>
