<p>Dark options are best with white cabinets in modern spaces especially if you have dark accents in your kitchen such as your backsplash. As easy-going as these cabinets may seem the thing is they can be a real designing challenge for the kitchen as a whole. As quirky and far-out as the colorful walls are they will provide consistency to the room. Dont forget the little things like the finish and location of your outlets or appliances that are as handsome as they are functional.
